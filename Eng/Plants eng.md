## Foraging
The character must spend **4 hours foraging**. During this time, they can make 2 **searches**, or 4 if they have an affinity with nature: barbarian, druid, etc.

The player indicates beforehand which plant(s) they are looking for. For each search, they roll 1d6 and consult the tables below to see if they found what they were seeking.		

Example: a barbarian spends 4 hours foraging. As his class has an affinity with nature, he can make 4 searches. He wants to do 2 searches for Pilgrim’s Herb and 1 for Coke-Pollen. For the Pilgrim’s Herb, he rolls 2d6 and gets a 3 and a 4, which allows him to find one. For Coke-Pollen, he rolls 2d6 and gets a 2 and a 6, finding none.
